ToDo APP encourages you to complete your daily tasks, reduces forgetfulness, assists you in recording the little things in your life, acts as a second brain, a tool for you to use, increases your productivity, and allows your brain to be used for thinking in a procrastination-prone environment. It strengthens your approach, makes you feel like you know everything there is to know about your life, makes you feel like you're expanding your knowledge base, and makes you feel like your time and money are being put to good use.
